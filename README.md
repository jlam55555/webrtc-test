Experimenting with WebRTC technologies for peer-to-peer connections

### Description
This creates a WebRTC peer-to-peer connection between the webpage and itself. This is in preparation for more advanced connections. This corresponds to my introduction to WebRTC at my article ["Better RTC with WebRTC"](http://eis.jonathanlam.tech/posts/better-rtc-with-webrtc), and is meant to linearly show the sequence of steps necessary to setting up a WebRTC connection.

This needs to be run on a web server (cannot be run statically).
